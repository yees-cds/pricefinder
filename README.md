# The Fabulous Price Finder #

## Overview of the app ##

This app gathers the prices of items in an online store, so you don't have to check back regularly to see if those items are on sale.  To see a running version of the app, visit http://fabulouspricefinder.mybluemix.net.

This is a Python app that uses the [Bottle framework](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) and a Cloudant database.
